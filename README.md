## Movie Recommendation System

A smart movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. Built using Python and machine learning techniques to deliver personalized or popular movie suggestions.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by helping users discover new movies theyâ€™re likely to enjoy. Depending on the implementation, the system uses **content-based filtering**, **collaborative filtering**, or a **hybrid approach** to recommend relevant movies.

### ðŸš€ Features

* Recommends movies based on user input (title, genre, or rating history)
* Clean and simple user interface (Streamlit web app)
* Uses similarity metrics or collaborative filtering
* Fast and scalable recommendation engine

Let me know what filtering method you used, and I can adjust the model description for you (e.g., if you used cosine similarity, SVD, or user ratings).
